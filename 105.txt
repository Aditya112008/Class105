standard deviation is a measure of how spreadout a dataset is ..
without calclating the standard deviation of the data we cannot know whetherthe data is closed to the average or the data is spreadout over a wide range

x = is the value in the datasheet
mean = sum of values / total number of values
n = number of values in the datasheet 

x - mean 
square of (x - mean)
find the sum of [square of (x - mean)]

standard deviation = square root of [find the sum of [square of (x - mean)]/n-1]
